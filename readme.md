# ü§ñ Bot Description

This bot functions as a manager for voice channels, primarily for conducting interviews. It automatically moves users with a specific role, like an "interviewer," to a designated channel whitelist. When a whitelisted person, who needs to conduct an interview, enters the waiting voice channel, the bot relocates both individuals to an available interview room. If the first room is occupied, it smartly shifts them to another available room, and if needed, to a third one.

## üîë Key Features

1. **Automated Interview Scheduling**: The bot handles interview scheduling, removing the need for manual coordination and reducing administrative tasks.

2. **Dynamic Channel Assignment**: Upon confirming an interview, the bot assigns both the interviewer and the interviewee to a specific channel, making communication more efficient and collaborative.

3. **Personalized Notifications**: It sends personalized notifications to both parties, including interview time, channel location, and any additional instructions.

4. **Interviewer-Interviewee Matching**: Using advanced algorithms, the bot intelligently matches interviewers with suitable candidates based on predefined criteria, ensuring compatibility and productive interactions.
